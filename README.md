# Tumor Classification

This R file contains code to test machine learning models including KNN, decision trees, and random forest to classify tumors as malignant or benign based on measurement characteristics. The sensitivity was deemed as the most appropriate measure as I aspired to minimize the number of false negatives present. The KNN method has the highest sensitivity of 0.986. Taking the current average false negative rate of breast cancer identification in medicine today (2.23% of all cases), all machine learning algorithms had improved sensitivity compared to current methods.
